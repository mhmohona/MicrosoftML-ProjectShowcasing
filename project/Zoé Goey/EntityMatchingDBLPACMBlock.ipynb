    "# Entity Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of finding matching records in tables is called entity matching. It can be used for deduplication of tables or to link tables to merge the information that they contain. The question that we want to answer in this notebook is whether machine learning has something to add to traditional programming methods for entity matching and whether fancy deep learning approaches really outperform simpler machine learning moedels that have already been around for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this, we make use of two existing entity matching packages: the [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (PRLT), which offers support for traditional programmimng techniques and basic machine learning models and [DeepMatcher](https://anhaidgroup.github.io/deepmatcher/html/), a package that adopts deep learning techniques. We test both packages on  scientific bibliographic data from [ACM](https://www.acm.org/) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/), which we downloaded from the [Database Group Leipzig ](https://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/research/projects/object_matching/benchmark_datasets_for_entity_resolution). This is an independent dataset that was not used to advertise either of the two methods."

    "# Defining Candidate Links\n",
    "To translate the matching problem into a standard classification problem, we first form all possible combinations of rows in the DBLP table and rows in the ACM table. In other words, we form the Cartesian product of the indices of these tables. The DBLP table has 2616 rows and the the ACM table has 2294 rows, so this results in a collection of 2616 x 2294 = 6001104 combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this set of possible links now places us for a dilemma:\n",
    "1. We would like to use as much of the data as possible to reach a sound conclusion\n",
    "2. DeepMatcher is not that fast and will take ages to process such a  large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this dilemma, we apply a technique that is commonly used in entity matching: _blocking_. By using a simple heuristic, we filter out row combinations, of which we can be (almost) certain that they do not match. By blocking these row combinations, we end up with a considerably smaller set of candidate links that is much easier to manage. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform blocking, we make use of the string comparison capabilities of the [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We block all combinations with a [Lehvenstein-distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)-based similarity measure that is smaller than 0.3, where 0 indicates a complete mismatch and 1 indicates identical strings. By doing this, we reduce the number of candidate links to 162894, which amounts to a data reduction of about 97%."

DeepMatcher takes in a table with record pairs of the two tables, which need to be matched. The records of the first table  are marked by adding the prefix \"left_\" to their feature names, and the records of the second table are marked by adding the prefix \"right_\". The target variable that indicates whether a pair forms a match is called \"label\" and takes on the vlaues 0 (no match) or 1 (match). To prevent unwanted correlations between the subsequent rows, we additionally shuffle the table."

We take over the values of he DeepMatcher [\"Getting started\"-notebook](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher/blob/master/examples/getting_started.ipynb), but make a couple of small adjustments. Knowing that an epoch will take about half an hour on Google Colab and 2 hours on our local machine, we limit the number of epochs to 8 instead of 10, and since we have not seen any substantial benefit of weighting in smaller experiments, we practically disable it by setting pos_neg_ratio = 1.\n",

The F1-measure is more suitable than accuracy in thie case, because even in the blocked dataset, the fraction of true matches is very small (about 1.4% )."

    "We are now ready to switch to the the [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which uses a simpler approach to feature engineering. Basically, we fill a vector with zeros of ones that indicate whether a record pair matches with respect to a certain column. So for each of the columns in the left/right tables, we define how similar they need to be to be matching. All the values of the per-column-matches are then concatenated to a global feature vector of zeros and ones, where  an all zero vector means that the pair matches in none of the columns, an an all-one-vectir indicates a match with respect to every column. This vector of zeros and ones is then fed to the various classifier models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define when we call two colum values matching, we let ourselves be inspired by the [example](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/link_two_dataframes.html) that the [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides in its introductory text. Here most of the column matches are defined in terms of a similarity that is based on the [Jaro Winkler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance). The only small adaptation that we make is in the choice of the similarity threshold value for \"venue\", because a short inspection of the data indicates that matching records tend to agree less with respect to \"venue\" than they do with respect to \"title\" or 'author\"."

There are three super vised methods (Logistic regression, Naive Bayes and Support vector machines) and two unsupervised methods (K-Means and [ECM](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.3828&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). We also add a simple heuristic that we label as \"Hand-tuned\". This basically looks whether records match on the majority of columns (more ones than zeroes in the feature vector) and classifies a pair as a match if this is the case. We assume that this heuristic as a proxy for traditional programming methods as implemented in tools like Power BI, since these are also based on string edit distances. \n",

    "The results of the heuristic and the various models on the validation set is displayed below. As we can see, all the supervised  trained models clearly outperform the simple heuristic, whereas the best [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model only slightly underperforms the much more complicated and time-consuming [DeepMatcher](https://anhaidgroup.github.io/deepmatcher/html/) model. Interestingly, the unsupervised ECM model also is a significant gain compared to the simple heuristic, indicating that also without labels, a machine learning approach can be beneficial."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Our analysis seems to indicate that machine learning approaches can be beneficial in the context of entity matching, but that the question whether deep learning really outperforms more traditional M models can eb debated. Much will probably bedepend on the nature of the dataset and  the amount of time that one wished to invets in labeling data and training the model. An interesting observation is that at least on out not too complicated dataset, the unsupervised ECM method also show a very decent performance, which indicates that one can already gain soemthing from machine learning without labeling the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furyher research could be geared towards the effect of fetaure engineering on the methods (DeepMatcher used other geatrues than PRLT) and on the question to what extent our simple heuristic was a good proxy to traditional programming methods implemented in existing entity matching systems."

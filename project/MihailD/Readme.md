0.  My idea: a voice conversation with a chatbot, from which to hear the voice of the person no longer exists.

There is already an Artificial Intelligence example, called Sophia, that carries coherent discussions.

You can see here a voice conversation with Sophia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml9v3wHLuWI

What if the voice of Sophia was really the voice of a person?

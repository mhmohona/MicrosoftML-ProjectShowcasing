# Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Scholarship Project Showcasing Challenge

A challenge to keep and showcase all the open sources projects that are implemented from individual or study groups of Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Scholarship from Udacity.

**For whom:** Individuals or study groups

## Timeline: 
**Start date:** 28 August 2020, 00.01am UTC <br />
**End date:** 20 September 2020, 11.59pm UTC


## Rules:

- Knowledge gained from the coursework must be implemented.
- Project must have been created during the Azure scholarship period.
- Registration form must be completed.
- Project must be submitted before the deadline.
- One can participate in multiple projects. 
- Project members' names should be clearly mentioned in the project proposal.
- Make sure your submission is in usable format, as it will be accessed by the judges.
- All projects submitted to this competition must record original work which has not been done or used previously.  Plagiarism is - grounds for disqualification. 

## Submission:

Participants must submit the following materials: 

- **Project proposal:** Markdown file (ReadMe.md) which explains the project and the team: Team members’ name; what the project does; who the project is for; used technology, etc. 
- **Project Implementation:** Juyter notebook and/or pdf file and/or Presentation video (1 to 3 minute) pitch.

## Guidelines:

Please structure your submission using the following steps:
- Create a directory with your slack username in the [project folder](https://github.com/mhmohona/MicrosoftML-ProjectShowcasing/tree/master/project). If you're new to GitHub, you can follow this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11y1MESDAGZmxdGNefh1mg3VnbJL1TcFcdfducD5c5zE/edit?usp=sharing) by @jhonatantirado
- For implementation, include a Jupyter notebook (if you are using) or a report (in pdf format) that demonstrates a run of your code showing printed output, graphs, etc.
- Structure your code into one or more modules in that directory
  - Code should be well-documented. This will help viewers to understand why and what you have done.
- If you are using Jupyter notebook please make sure about the following points:
  - Code cells in the notebook should only call functions defined in your modules. Please do not include any actual code logic in the notebook itself. 
  - The notebooks should be well-documented. Ideally, each code cell should be preceded by a Markdown cell describing why you have included the code cell. It can also include comments on the output generated, eg. describing features of a graph. These text cells should be more high-level than actual code comments, describing the narrative or thought process behind your steps.
- If you are not able to finish the code by the deadline, include your idea, design and implementation strategy in the report.
- If you are using Azure ML Designer: add the screenshots of the design, results, diagrams in the pdf report or Jupyter notebook.
- Free Azure Credits:
  - [Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
